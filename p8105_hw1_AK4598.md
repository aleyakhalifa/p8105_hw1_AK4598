# Problem 1

First, I load the `moderndive` package and the `early_january_weather`
dataset. I will show my code throughout.

``` r
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset reflects hourly weather data for three New York City
airports during the month of January 2013. The dataset contains 358 rows
and 15 columns. The columns consist of the variables, `origin` (the
weather station emitting the data - in this case, just EWR airport),
`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp` (temperature), `dewp` (dewpoint),
`humid` (humidity), `wind_dir` (wind direction), `wind_speed`,
`wind_gust`, `precip` (precipitation in inches), `pressure` (sea level
pressure), `visib` (visibility in miles), and `time_hour` (the date/time
of the recording).

``` r
mean_temp = mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
```

Using the above code, the mean temperature reported in this dataset is
39.58.

Below is a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs. `time_hour` (x).

``` r
scatter = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()

scatter
```

The color legend reflects *relative humidity*. We can see a cyclical
relationship between temperature and time, in that temperatures decrease
each night and rise again each day. However, over the entire period,
average daily temperatures are increasing. Finally, humidity was lowest
at the beginning of the period and highest between January 10-14.

The scatterplot is saved in the project directory.

# Problem 2

## Create a dataframe.

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    random_samp = rnorm(10, mean=0),
    logical = random_samp>0,
    character = c("dave",
                  "anshana",
                  "janan",
                  "harry",
                  "kiki",
                  "john",
                  "george",
                  "amir",
                  "max",
                  "gabriella"),
    factor = as.factor(c("low",
                         "middle",
                         "high",
                         "low",
                         "middle",
                         "high",
                         "high",
                         "middle",
                         "high",
                         "low"))
  )
```

## Try taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

It works for the `random_samp` variable.

``` r
mean(pull(df,random_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.06746674

It works for the logical variable, but the output is not exactly a
*mean*. It is a representation of the proportion of rows that are TRUE.

``` r
mean(pull(df,logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

It does not work for the character variable…

``` r
mean(pull(df,character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

… or the factor variable.

``` r
mean(pull(df,factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA
